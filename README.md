# Nova-Scotia-Power-Energy-Demand-Forecasting-For-2025
About Dataset
Nova Scotia Power(NSP) is the organization responsible for managing the electricity system and ensuring the reliable operation of the electrical grid in Nova Scotia, Canada.

One of the primary roles of NSP is to balance the supply and demand of electricity in Nova Scotia. They do this by predicting the amount of electricity that will be needed at any given time and coordinating the generation and distribution of that electricity to ensure that the supply matches the demand.

To accomplish this, NSP uses a variety of tools and processes to monitor and manage the electrical grid. These include real-time monitoring of electricity usage, dispatching power plants to generate electricity as needed, and managing the flow of electricity across the grid to ensure that it reaches the areas where it is needed most.

NSP also works closely with electricity generators, transmission and distribution companies, and other stakeholders to plan for the future of Ontario's electricity system. This includes forecasting future energy demand, developing new sources of electricity generation, and implementing policies to encourage energy conservation and efficiency.

This dataset contains hourly information on the hourly total net load in MW from 2022 to 2024.

hour: Hour 1 is from 12 am. to 1 am., Hour 2 is from 1 am. to 2 am. Hours 1-24 are the hours from midnight one day through midnight the next day. Atlantic Standard Time is used year-round.

Date/time: Date and time of recorded net load in "Y-MM-DD HH:MM" format.

Load[M/W]: total hourly net load in MWh

The aim of this project is to predict the hourly and monthly net load for 2025.
